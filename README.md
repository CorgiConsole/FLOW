# FLOW
repository for my senior design project FLOW (Fun Low-powered Observer-interactive Waterfall)

I am just using this as a repository for the source files I am writing for my project. Without the correct libraries this project will not compile. If you have any questions about this project please email me at connor.heckman@me.com, thanks!
